Original code:
int a = 5, b = 3, res;
res = a + b << 1;

Problem:
The '+' operator is evaluated before '<<', so res = (a + b) << 1 = 16. 
The developer expected 11.

Corrections:
1. Using parentheses:
   res = a + (b << 1);

2. Using arithmetic instead of bitwise:
   res = a + (b * 2);

Both give res = 11.
