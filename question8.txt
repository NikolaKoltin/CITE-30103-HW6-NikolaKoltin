Global variable:
- Declared outside main()
- Accessible anywhere in the program
- Example: globalVar = 10

Local variable:
- Declared inside main()
- Only accessible within the function
- Example: localVar = 5

Scope difference:
Global variables exist for the entire program, while local variables exist only inside the function where they are declared.
