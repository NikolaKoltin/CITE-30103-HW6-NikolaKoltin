This repo has all my C programs and text answers for Homework 6.

How to Compile and Run Programs

To compile a program:
gcc question1.c -o question1

To run it:
./question1

- Change the file name for other programs (question2.c, question3.c, etc.).  
- Screenshots of outputs are in the screenshots/ folder.  
- Text answers are in .txt files (like question3.txt).
