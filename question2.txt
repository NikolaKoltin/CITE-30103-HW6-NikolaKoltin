1. Preprocessing
   - The preprocessor handles things like #include and #define.
   - Possible error: A header file might be missing.

2. Compilation
   - The compiler checks the C code and turns it into assembly.
   - Possible error: A syntax error, like a missing semicolon.

3. Assembly
   - The assembler converts the assembly code into machine code (an object file).
   - Possible error: Invalid assembly instruction.

4. Linking
   - The linker connects all object files and needed libraries into one executable.
   - Possible error: “Undefined reference” if a function is not found.

5. Loading
   - The OS loads the program into memory and starts running it.
   - Possible error: A missing library at load time or a run-time crash.
